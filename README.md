const mydrive = new drive(token) // create a new instance drive class with you token on it
const fs = require('fs').promises // import fs to use file system
// Function declaration to download the file
async function saveStreamInFile(fileId){
	res = await mydrive.download(id=fileId)
	for await (const chunk of res.body){
		fs.writeFile("./filename.extension",chunk,{flag:"a+"})
	}
}
saveStreamInFile(file-id) // call the function 
```
